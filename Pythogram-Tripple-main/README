Pythagorean Triple Detection (Pythagorean Theorem Implementation)

Description:
 * This project usually involves writing a Python program to determine if three given numbers form a Pythagorean triple (a, b, c) where a^2 + b^2 = c^2.
 * It's a foundational exercise that reinforces basic programming logic, conditional statements, and mathematical operations in Python.
 * It is a good way to get comfortable with user input or reading data from small files.

Key Skills Demonstrated:
 * Python programming fundamentals.
 * Mathematical operations.
 * Conditional logic (if/else statements).
 * Basic function creation.
