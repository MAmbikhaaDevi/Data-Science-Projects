Diamond Price Prediction (Regression Analysis)

Description:
   * Similar to house price prediction, this project aims to predict the price of a diamond based on its characteristics (e.g., carat, cut, color, clarity).
   * It often involves dealing with categorical variables and handling skewed distributions.
   * This dataset is very popular, and allows for the implementation of many different regression models.

Key Skills Demonstrated:
   * Handling categorical data (one-hot encoding, label encoding).
   * Feature scaling and normalization.
   * Regression modeling and evaluation.
   * Outlier detection and handling.
Significance:
   * Reinforces regression skills with a different dataset.
   * Exposure to handling categorical features.
