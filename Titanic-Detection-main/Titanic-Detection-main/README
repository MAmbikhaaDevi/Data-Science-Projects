Titanic Survival Prediction (Classification Analysis)

Description:
   1. This is a classic binary classification problem where you build a model to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not, based on features like age, gender, and class.
   2. Typical steps include:
        * Data cleaning (handling missing values).
        * EDA to understand survival patterns.
        * Feature engineering.
        * Model selection (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines).
        * Model training and evaluation (using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

Key Skills Demonstrated:
   * Classification modeling with Scikit-learn.
   * Handling missing data.
   * Feature selection.
   * Model evaluation for classification problems.
   * Understanding of the implications of false positives and false negatives.

Significance:
  * Introduces classification problems and evaluation metrics.
  * A popular beginner-friendly dataset.
