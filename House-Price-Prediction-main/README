House Price Prediction (Regression Analysis)

Description:
  1. This is a common regression problem where you build a model to predict the price of a house based on its features (e.g., square footage, number of bedrooms, location).
  2. Typical steps include:
        * Data cleaning and preprocessing.
        * Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature relationships.
        * Feature engineering to create new relevant features.
        * Model selection (e.g., linear regression, random forest regression, gradient boosting).
        * Model training and evaluation (using metrics like mean squared error or R-squared).

Key Skills Demonstrated:
   * Data manipulation with Pandas.
   * Data visualization with Matplotlib or Seaborn.
   * Regression modeling with Scikit-learn.
   * Model evaluation.
   * Feature engineering.

Significance:
   * Practical application of regression techniques.
   * Understanding of real-world data and its complexities.
